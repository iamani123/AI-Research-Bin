One advantage that MFEC and NEC both hold over the other algorithms is that they do not require rewards to be clipped to the range [-1, 1] for training stability. In environments where rewards can vary significantly in magnitude, unlike the other algorithms, NEC and MFEC are able to learn the difference between large and small rewards.
